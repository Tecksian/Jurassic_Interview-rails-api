<p>Jurassic Interview open-alpha! Dinosaurs? YES! Cages? YES! Overcrowded
cages, dinos in unpowered cages, dinos eating each other? Um, well, yeah.
But your participation in this open alpha is crucial to knowing what we
need to include in the release-day patch!</p>

<h1 id="label-Version+1-2C+or+-27pretty+sure+it+works-27...">Version 1, or &#39;pretty sure it works&#39;…<span><a href="#label-Version+1-2C+or+-27pretty+sure+it+works-27...">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Dinosaurs? YES! Cages? Yes! Dinosaurs running loose, and unavoidably
fighting and/or eating each other due to your inability to intelligently
query and assign your assets? Not so much. Sorry, folks – liability
insurance was the end of the carnage you enjoyed in the open alpha…</p>

<ul><li>
<p>On multi-threading</p>
</li></ul>

<p>By design, the vast majority of the validation and logic is already
concentrated in the models, which is helpful. But not nearly sufficient –
in a multi-threaded environment, I would change the validations to employ
class methods and variables, rather than instance methods/variables. This
would allow us to employ a useful @@lock = Mutex new to keep things in
order. Alternatively, or more likely in addition to,  if were truly
incredible resource demands then I might employ a queuing system in <a
href="ApplicationController.html">ApplicationController</a>.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On this test</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Fantastic test. Easily both the best and my favorite among the programming
excercises I&#39;ve experienced to date. Fun, deceptively simple, and one
must fight the urge to both 1)build more than is needed (a little guilty
myself, here) and 2) go back and redo it when you realize the way you
<strong>should</strong> have done it!</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On unfinished business requirements</p>
</li></ul>

<p>I believe I got them all. However, given (not much) more time I
would&#39;ve strongly preferred to implement an &#39;easy button&#39; cage
assignment method. Givenn the limited restrictions, it should be
straightforward. And both the operators oand the users&#39; lives are
improved by being able to say &#39;put this dinosaur in a cage&#39; rather
than &#39;put this dinosaur in that cage&#39;. On a more technical level, I
would&#39;ve preferred to implement a single filter mechanism in
ActionController which the descendant controllers can call, but there
wasn&#39;t time.</p>

<h1 id="label-What+you+didn-27t+ask+me+to+comment+on-2C+but+I-27m+commenting+on+it+anyways">What you didn&#39;t ask me to comment on, but I&#39;m commenting on it anyways<span><a href="#label-What+you+didn-27t+ask+me+to+comment+on-2C+but+I-27m+commenting+on+it+anyways">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<h1 id="label-INITIAL+NOTES">INITIAL NOTES<span><a href="#label-INITIAL+NOTES">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>For simplicity&#39;s sake, I&#39;m not implementing two elements that I
typically would:</p>

<p>1) a custom api namespace: Normally I&#39;d do this so that api paths went
like /api/dinosaurs/etc…, to preserve the ability to make standard
view-based pages accessible for a user interface. It also helps with
versioning, which brings us to:</p>

<p>2) versioning. Especially with apis, you&#39;d want to make sure you have
different modules, namespaces, etc for your versioning your controllers.
However, in the simple model case like this interview, it seems excessive.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On tone</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Our tone in this document (aside from the &#39;Royal We&#39; that I
can&#39;t seem to shake from academic writing) is jovial. I tend towards
this in excercises and interviews at baseline, as it gives a better
indication of what it&#39;s like to work with me.</p>

<p>However – given the humor and whimsy in both the job description (artisan
coffee, whiteboards, etc) and the excercise itself I felt especially bold
in that respect.</p>

<h1 id="label-Developing+thoughts">Developing thoughts<span><a href="#label-Developing+thoughts">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
<ul><li>
<p>On testing</p>
</li></ul>

<p>We are unusually, but deliberately, including only the barest testing for
the base models. This is not reflective of my design philosophy – which is
<strong>almost</strong> that thorough testing helps me understand the app
as much as it helps reliability for users. However, given the time limit,
the simplicty of these models, and the fact that the project description
specified only tests for the business logic, we skimp on the basics.</p>

<p>In fact, I admire and often employ the development approach of writing the
tests first. Sure, they all fail, but it helps with so many things – not
the least of which is scope creep. Sad Panda.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On ease of use</p>
</li></ul>

<p>We&#39;ve done some things not listed in the requirements or business
logic, because they illustrate our typical approach.</p>

<p>For example, serializing the JSON and (planning to) allow the user to do
queries with a non-nested request are both things that take time but
weren&#39;t required. However, we believe that the &#39;principle of least
surprise&#39; is sometimes best achieved via lessening complexity.</p>

<p>In the end, we don&#39;t want to be &#39;that guy&#39; that responds to
users with: “Well, you forgot to wave your left hand above your head after
the 18th step in the dance.”</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On documentation</p>
</li></ul>

<p>I prefer to document as I go along. Typically I revise often, but in this
case a &#39;stream of consciousness&#39; style <a
href="README_rdoc.html">README</a> might help give insight into my
development mindset/approach/etc.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On general approach</p>
</li></ul>

<p>We intend to implement most of the business logic at the model level. There
are numerous advantages to this – which motivated the classic Ruby advice
&#39;fat model, skinny controller&#39;</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On shuffling and testing</p>
</li></ul>

<p>We like it! Shuffling isn&#39;t randomizing, but that&#39;s good because it
helps get more complete coverage. It can cause debugging to be more
problematic, but this is avoidable via the use of specific random seeds.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On completion time</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Please note the huge time difference between batches of github commits.
Though I was attempting to sticking to the 5 hour limit, it&#39;s
possible-to-likely I went over it simply because it&#39;s harder to track
time spend when you are occasionally interrupted by a wonderful but
ranmbunctious pair of children…especially when they are your own, so it
would be illegal to ignore them.</p>

<p>ALSO: Writing the documentation as I went on was a large chunk out of the
time. Our preference is to document as we go (here done often in the
comments), rather than build until you&#39;re done and
<strong>then</strong> (complain while) tending to the documentation.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On releases</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Why do two releases for such a simple project? To illustrate my general
approach of basic-working-tested-&gt;release_basic-&gt;advanced_stuff,
testing, etc-&gt; more useful releases.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On comments</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For these sorts of excercises, we enjoy explaining more than just the bare
descriptions for use by automatic document generators. For rease of
reading, I&#39;ll compile a list of the longer comments. Please be assured,
however, that in a professional environment I don&#39;t spam the comments
the way I do here.</p>

<h1 id="label-Final+thoughts">Final thoughts<span><a href="#label-Final+thoughts">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>There&#39;s an embarassing amount of refactoring, optimization, and
structural improvements I could make, had I an extra few hours. We
don&#39;t, so we are committing/releasing as it is now. However, I do
intend to create an &#39;If time had permitted&#39; branch.…so if there are
concerns about the DRY-ness of &#39;Rubyist&#39; nature of my code, do
consider taking a look there as well?</p>
