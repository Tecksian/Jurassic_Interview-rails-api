<p>Jurassic Interview open-alpha! Dinosaurs? YES! Cages? YES! Overcrowded
cages, dinos in unpowered cages, dinos eating each other? Um, well, yeah.
But your participation in this open alpha is crucial to knowing what we
need to include in the release-day patch!</p>

<p>For simplicity&#39;s sake, I&#39;m not implementing two elements that I
typically would:</p>

<p>1) a custom api namespace: Normally I&#39;d do this so that api paths went
like /api/dinosaurs/etc…, to preserve the ability to make standard
view-based pages accessible for a user interface. It also helps with
versioning, which brings us to:</p>

<p>2) versioning. Especially with apis, you&#39;d want to make sure you have
different modules, namespaces, etc for your versioning your controllers.
However, in the simple model case like this interview, it seems excessive.</p>

<ul><li>
<p>On testing</p>
</li></ul>

<p>We are unusually, but deliberately, including only the barest testing for
the base models. This is not reflective of my design philosophy – which is
<strong>almost</strong> that thorough testing helps me understand the app
as much as it helps reliability for users. However, given the time limit,
the simplicty of these models, and the fact that the project description
specified only tests for the business logic, we skimp on the basics.</p>

<p>In fact, I admire and often employ the development approach of writing the
tests first. Sure, they all fail, but it helps with so many things – not
the least of which is scope creep. Sad Panda.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On documentation</p>
</li></ul>

<p>I prefer to document as I go along. Typically I revise often, but in this
case a &#39;stream of consciousness&#39; style <a
href="README_rdoc.html">README</a> might help give insight into my
development mindset/approach/etc.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On general approach</p>
</li></ul>

<p>We intend to implement most of the business logic at the model level. More
on this to come, but there are advantages to letting the Ruby framework do
the heavy lifting for us..</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On shuffling and testing</p>
</li></ul>

<p>We like it! Shuffling isn&#39;t randomizing, but that&#39;s good because it
helps get more complete coverage. It can cause debugging to be more
problematic, but this is avoidable via the use of specific random seeds.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On completion time</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Please note the huge time difference between batches of github commits.
Sticking to the 5 hour limit, just didn&#39;t do it in one sitting.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>On releases</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Why do two releases for such a simple project? To illustrate my general
approach of basic-working-tested-&gt;release_basic-&gt;advanced_stuff,
testing, etc-&gt; more useful releases</p>
